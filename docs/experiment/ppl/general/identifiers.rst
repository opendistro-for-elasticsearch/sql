Introduction
============

Identifiers are used for naming your database objects, such as index name, field name, alias etc. Basically there are two types of identifiers: regular identifiers and delimited identifiers.


Regular Identifiers
===================

Description
-----------

A regular identifier is a string of characters that must start with ASCII letter (lower or upper case). The subsequent character can be a combination of letter, digit, underscore (``_``). It cannot be a reversed key word. And whitespace and other special characters are not allowed.

For Elasticsearch, the following identifiers are supported extensionally:

1. Identifiers prefixed by dot ``.``: this is called hidden index in Elasticsearch, for example ``.kibana``.
2. Identifiers prefixed by at sign ``@``: this is common for meta fields generated in Logstash ingestion.
3. Identifiers with ``-`` in the middle: this is mostly the case for index name with date information.
4. Identifiers with star ``*`` present: this is mostly an index pattern for wildcard match.

Examples
--------

Here are examples for using index pattern directly without quotes::

    od> source=accounts | fields account_number, firstname, lastname;
    fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
    +------------------+-------------+------------+
    | account_number   | firstname   | lastname   |
    |------------------+-------------+------------|
    | 1                | Amber       | Duke       |
    | 6                | Hattie      | Bond       |
    | 13               | Nanette     | Bates      |
    | 18               | Dale        | Adams      |
    +------------------+-------------+------------+


Delimited Identifiers
=====================

Description
-----------

A delimited identifier is an identifier enclosed in back ticks `````. In this case, the identifier enclosed is not necessarily a regular identifier. In other words, it can contain any special character not allowed by regular identifier.

Use Cases
---------

Here are typical examples of the use of delimited identifiers:

1. Identifiers of reserved key word name
2. Identifiers with dot ``.`` present: similarly as ``-`` in index name to include date information, it is required to be quoted so parser can differentiate it from identifier with qualifiers.
3. Identifiers with other special character: Elasticsearch has its own rule which allows more special character, for example Unicode character is supported in index name.

Examples
--------

Here are examples for quoting an index name by back ticks::

    od> source=`accounts` | fields `account_number`;
    fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
    +------------------+
    | account_number   |
    |------------------|
    | 1                |
    | 6                |
    | 13               |
    | 18               |
    +------------------+


Case Sensitivity
================

Description
-----------

Identifiers are treated in case sensitive manner. So it must be exactly same as what is stored in Elasticsearch.

Examples
--------

For example, if you run ``source=Accounts``, it will end up with an index not found exception from our plugin because the actual index name is under lower case.
