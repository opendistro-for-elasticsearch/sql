Introduction
============

Expressions, particularly value expressions, are those which return a scalar value. Expressions have different types and forms. For example, there are literal values as atom expression and arithmetic, predicate and function expression built on top of them. And also expressions can be used in different clauses, such as using arithmetic expression in ``SELECT``, ``WHERE`` or ``HAVING`` clause.

Literal Values
==============

Description
-----------

A literal is a symbol that represents a value. The most common literal values include:

1. Numeric literals: specify numeric values such as integer and floating-point numbers.
2. String literals: specify a string enclosed by single or double quotes.
3. Boolean literals: ``true`` or ``false``.

Examples
--------

Here is an example for different type of literals::

    od> SELECT 123, 'hello', false, -4.567;
    fetched rows / total rows = 1/1
    +-------+-----------+---------+----------+
    | 123   | "hello"   | false   | -4.567   |
    |-------+-----------+---------+----------|
    | 123   | hello     | False   | -4.567   |
    +-------+-----------+---------+----------+

Limitations
-----------

The current implementation has the following limitations at the moment:

1. Only literals of data types listed as above are supported for now. Other type of literals, such as date and NULL, will be added in future.
2. Expression of literals, such as arithmetic expressions, will be supported later.
3. Standard ANSI ``VALUES`` clause is not supported, although the ``SELECT`` literal example above is implemented by a Values operator internally.
