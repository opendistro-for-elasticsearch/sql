Introduction
============

``SELECT`` statement in SQL is the most common query that retrieves data from Elasticsearch index. In this doc, only simple ``SELECT`` statement with single index and query involved is covered. A ``SELECT`` statement includes ``SELECT``, ``FROM``, ``WHERE``, ``GROUP BY``, ``HAVING``, ``ORDER BY`` and ``LIMIT`` clause. Among these clauses, ``SELECT`` and ``FROM`` are the foundation to specify which fields to be fetched and which index they should be fetched from. All others are optional and used according to your needs. Please read on for their description, syntax and use cases in details.

Syntax
------

The syntax of ``SELECT`` statement is as follows::

  SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] (* | expression) [[AS] alias] [, ...]
  FROM index_name
  [WHERE predicates]
  [GROUP BY expression [, ...]
   [HAVING predicates]]
  [ORDER BY expression [ASC | DESC] [NULLS {FIRST | LAST}] [, ...]]
  [LIMIT [offset, ] size]

Although multiple query statements to execute in batch is not supported, ending with semicolon ``;`` is still allowed. For example, you can run ``SELECT * FROM accounts;`` without issue. This is useful to support queries generated by other tool, such as Microsoft Excel or BI tool.

Fundamentals
------------

Apart from predefined keyword of SQL language, the most basic element is literal and identifier. Literal is numeric, string, date or boolean constant. Identifier represents Elasticsearch index or field name. With arithmetic operators and SQL functions applied, the basic literals and identifiers can be built into complex expression.

Rule ``expressionAtom``:

The expression in turn can be combined into predicate with logical operator. Typically, predicate is used in ``WHERE`` and ``HAVING`` clause to filter out data by conditions specified.

Rule ``expression``:

Rule ``predicate``:

Execution Order
---------------

The actual order of execution is very different from its appearance::

  FROM index
   WHERE predicates
    GROUP BY expressions
     HAVING predicates
      SELECT expressions
       ORDER BY expressions
        LIMIT size

Example 1: Selecting All Fields
-------------------------------

You can use ``*`` to fetch all fields in the index which is very convenient when you just want to have a quick look at your data.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : "SELECT * FROM accounts"
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 200
	}

Result set:

+--------------+---------+------+------+-------+--------+-----+------------------------+--------------------+--------+---+
|account_number|firstname|gender|  city|balance|employer|state|                   email|             address|lastname|age|
+==============+=========+======+======+=======+========+=====+========================+====================+========+===+
|             1|    Amber|     M|Brogan|  39225|  Pyrami|   IL|    amberduke@pyrami.com|     880 Holmes Lane|    Duke| 32|
+--------------+---------+------+------+-------+--------+-----+------------------------+--------------------+--------+---+
|             6|   Hattie|     M| Dante|   5686|  Netagy|   TN|   hattiebond@netagy.com|  671 Bristol Street|    Bond| 36|
+--------------+---------+------+------+-------+--------+-----+------------------------+--------------------+--------+---+
|            13|  Nanette|     F| Nogal|  32838| Quility|   VA|nanettebates@quility.com|  789 Madison Street|   Bates| 28|
+--------------+---------+------+------+-------+--------+-----+------------------------+--------------------+--------+---+
|            18|     Dale|     M| Orick|   4180|    null|   MD|     daleadams@boink.com|467 Hutchinson Court|   Adams| 33|
+--------------+---------+------+------+-------+--------+-----+------------------------+--------------------+--------+---+


Example 2: Selecting Specific Fields
------------------------------------

More often you would give specific field name(s) in ``SELECT`` clause to avoid large and unnecessary data retrieved.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : "SELECT firstname, lastname FROM accounts"
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 200,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "firstname",
	      "lastname"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  }
	}

Result set:

+---------+--------+
|firstname|lastname|
+=========+========+
|    Amber|    Duke|
+---------+--------+
|     Dale|   Adams|
+---------+--------+
|   Hattie|    Bond|
+---------+--------+
|  Nanette|   Bates|
+---------+--------+


Example 3: Using Field Alias
----------------------------

Alias is often used to make your query more readable by giving your field a shorter name.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : "SELECT account_number AS num FROM accounts"
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 200,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "account_number"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  }
	}

Result set:

+---+
|num|
+===+
|  1|
+---+
|  6|
+---+
| 13|
+---+
| 18|
+---+


Example 4: Selecting Distinct Fields
------------------------------------

By default, ``SELECT ALL`` takes effect to return all rows. ``DISTINCT`` is useful when you want to de-duplicate and get unique field value. You can provide one or more field names ('DISTINCT *' is not supported yet).

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : "SELECT DISTINCT age FROM accounts"
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 0,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "age"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  },
	  "stored_fields" : "age",
	  "aggregations" : {
	    "age" : {
	      "terms" : {
	        "field" : "age",
	        "size" : 200,
	        "min_doc_count" : 1,
	        "shard_min_doc_count" : 0,
	        "show_term_doc_count_error" : false,
	        "order" : [
	          {
	            "_count" : "desc"
	          },
	          {
	            "_key" : "asc"
	          }
	        ]
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}

Result set:

+---+
|age|
+===+
| 28|
+---+
| 32|
+---+
| 33|
+---+
| 36|
+---+

In fact your can use any expression in a ``DISTINCT`` clause as follows::

    od> SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTRING(lastname, 1, 1) FROM accounts;
    fetched rows / total rows = 3/3
    +-----------------------------+
    | SUBSTRING(lastname, 1, 1)   |
    |-----------------------------|
    | A                           |
    | B                           |
    | D                           |
    +-----------------------------+

FROM
====

Description
-----------

``FROM`` clause specifies Elasticsearch index where the data should be retrieved from. You've seen how to specify a single index in FROM clause in last section. Here we provide examples for more use cases.

Subquery in ``FROM`` clause is also supported. Please check out the documentation for more details.

Syntax
------

Rule ``tableName``:

.. image:: /docs/user/img/rdd/tableName.png

Example 1: Using Index Alias
----------------------------

Similarly you can give index in ``FROM`` clause an alias and use it across clauses in query.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : "SELECT acc.account_number FROM accounts acc"
	}

Example 2: Selecting From Multiple Indices by Index Pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Alternatively you can query from multiple indices of similar names by index pattern. This is very convenient for indices created by Logstash index template with date as suffix.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : "SELECT account_number FROM account*"
	}

Example 3: [Deprecating] Selecting From Specific Index Type
-----------------------------------------------------------

You can also specify type name explicitly though this has been deprecated in later Elasticsearch version.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : "SELECT account_number FROM accounts/account"
	}

WHERE
=====

Description
-----------

``WHERE`` clause specifies only Elasticsearch documents that meet the criteria should be affected. It consists of predicates that uses ``=``, ``<>``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``IN``, ``BETWEEN``, ``LIKE``, ``IS NULL`` or ``IS NOT NULL``. These predicates can be combined by logical operator ``NOT``, ``AND`` or ``OR`` to build more complex expression.

For ``LIKE`` and other full text search topics, please refer to Full Text Search documentation.

Besides SQL query, WHERE clause can also be used in SQL statement such as ``DELETE``. Please refer to Data Manipulation Language documentation for details.

Example 1: Comparison Operators
-------------------------------

Basic comparison operators, such as ``=``, ``<>``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``<``, ``<=``, can work for number, string or date. ``IN`` and ``BETWEEN`` is convenient for comparison with multiple values or a range.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : """
		SELECT account_number
		FROM accounts
		WHERE account_number = 1
		"""
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 200,
	  "query" : {
	    "bool" : {
	      "filter" : [
	        {
	          "bool" : {
	            "must" : [
	              {
	                "term" : {
	                  "account_number" : {
	                    "value" : 1,
	                    "boost" : 1.0
	                  }
	                }
	              }
	            ],
	            "adjust_pure_negative" : true,
	            "boost" : 1.0
	          }
	        }
	      ],
	      "adjust_pure_negative" : true,
	      "boost" : 1.0
	    }
	  },
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "account_number"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  }
	}

Result set:

+--------------+
|account_number|
+==============+
|             1|
+--------------+


Example 2: Missing Fields
-------------------------

As NoSQL database, Elasticsearch allows for flexible schema that documents in an index may have different fields. In this case, you can use ``IS NULL`` or ``IS NOT NULL`` to retrieve missing fields or existing fields only.

Note that for now we don't differentiate missing field and field set to ``NULL`` explicitly.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : """
		SELECT account_number, employer
		FROM accounts
		WHERE employer IS NULL
		"""
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 200,
	  "query" : {
	    "bool" : {
	      "filter" : [
	        {
	          "bool" : {
	            "must" : [
	              {
	                "bool" : {
	                  "must_not" : [
	                    {
	                      "exists" : {
	                        "field" : "employer.keyword",
	                        "boost" : 1.0
	                      }
	                    }
	                  ],
	                  "adjust_pure_negative" : true,
	                  "boost" : 1.0
	                }
	              }
	            ],
	            "adjust_pure_negative" : true,
	            "boost" : 1.0
	          }
	        }
	      ],
	      "adjust_pure_negative" : true,
	      "boost" : 1.0
	    }
	  },
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "account_number",
	      "employer"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  }
	}

Result set:

+--------------+--------+
|account_number|employer|
+==============+========+
|            18|    null|
+--------------+--------+


GROUP BY
========

Description
-----------

``GROUP BY`` groups documents with same field value into buckets. It is often used along with aggregation functions to aggregate inside each bucket. Please refer to SQL Functions documentation for more details.

Note that ``WHERE`` clause is applied before ``GROUP BY`` clause.

Example 1: Grouping by Fields
-----------------------------

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : """
		SELECT age
		FROM accounts
		GROUP BY age
		"""
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 0,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "age"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  },
	  "stored_fields" : "age",
	  "aggregations" : {
	    "age" : {
	      "terms" : {
	        "field" : "age",
	        "size" : 200,
	        "min_doc_count" : 1,
	        "shard_min_doc_count" : 0,
	        "show_term_doc_count_error" : false,
	        "order" : [
	          {
	            "_count" : "desc"
	          },
	          {
	            "_key" : "asc"
	          }
	        ]
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}

Result set:

+---+
|age|
+===+
| 28|
+---+
| 32|
+---+
| 33|
+---+
| 36|
+---+


Example 2: Grouping by Field Alias
----------------------------------

Field alias is accessible in ``GROUP BY`` clause.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : """
		SELECT account_number AS num
		FROM accounts
		GROUP BY num
		"""
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 0,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "account_number"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  },
	  "stored_fields" : "account_number",
	  "aggregations" : {
	    "num" : {
	      "terms" : {
	        "field" : "account_number",
	        "size" : 200,
	        "min_doc_count" : 1,
	        "shard_min_doc_count" : 0,
	        "show_term_doc_count_error" : false,
	        "order" : [
	          {
	            "_count" : "desc"
	          },
	          {
	            "_key" : "asc"
	          }
	        ]
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}

Result set:

+---+
|num|
+===+
|  1|
+---+
|  6|
+---+
| 13|
+---+
| 18|
+---+


Example 3: Grouping by Ordinal
------------------------------

Alternatively field ordinal in ``SELECT`` clause can be used too. However this is not recommended because your ``GROUP BY`` clause depends on fields in ``SELECT`` clause and require to change accordingly.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : """
		SELECT age
		FROM accounts
		GROUP BY 1
		"""
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 0,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "age"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  },
	  "stored_fields" : "age",
	  "aggregations" : {
	    "age" : {
	      "terms" : {
	        "field" : "age",
	        "size" : 200,
	        "min_doc_count" : 1,
	        "shard_min_doc_count" : 0,
	        "show_term_doc_count_error" : false,
	        "order" : [
	          {
	            "_count" : "desc"
	          },
	          {
	            "_key" : "asc"
	          }
	        ]
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}

Result set:

+---+
|age|
+===+
| 28|
+---+
| 32|
+---+
| 33|
+---+
| 36|
+---+


Example 4: Grouping by Scalar Function
--------------------------------------

Scalar function can be used in ``GROUP BY`` clause and it's required to be present in ``SELECT`` clause too.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : """
		SELECT ABS(age) AS a
		FROM accounts
		GROUP BY ABS(age)
		"""
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 0,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "script"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  },
	  "stored_fields" : "abs(age)",
	  "script_fields" : {
	    "abs(age)" : {
	      "script" : {
	        "source" : "def abs_1 = Math.abs(doc['age'].value);return abs_1;",
	        "lang" : "painless"
	      },
	      "ignore_failure" : false
	    }
	  },
	  "aggregations" : {
	    "abs(age)" : {
	      "terms" : {
	        "script" : {
	          "source" : "def abs_1 = Math.abs(doc['age'].value);return abs_1;",
	          "lang" : "painless"
	        },
	        "size" : 200,
	        "min_doc_count" : 1,
	        "shard_min_doc_count" : 0,
	        "show_term_doc_count_error" : false,
	        "order" : [
	          {
	            "_count" : "desc"
	          },
	          {
	            "_key" : "asc"
	          }
	        ]
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}

Result set:

HAVING
======

Description
-----------

``HAVING`` clause filters result from ``GROUP BY`` clause by predicate(s). Because of this, aggregation function, even different from those on ``SELECT`` clause, can be used in predicate.

Example
-------

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : """
		SELECT age, MAX(balance)
		FROM accounts
		GROUP BY age
		HAVING MIN(balance) > 10000
		"""
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 0,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "age",
	      "MAX"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  },
	  "stored_fields" : "age",
	  "aggregations" : {
	    "age" : {
	      "terms" : {
	        "field" : "age",
	        "size" : 200,
	        "min_doc_count" : 1,
	        "shard_min_doc_count" : 0,
	        "show_term_doc_count_error" : false,
	        "order" : [
	          {
	            "_count" : "desc"
	          },
	          {
	            "_key" : "asc"
	          }
	        ]
	      },
	      "aggregations" : {
	        "MAX_0" : {
	          "max" : {
	            "field" : "balance"
	          }
	        },
	        "min_0" : {
	          "min" : {
	            "field" : "balance"
	          }
	        },
	        "bucket_filter" : {

ORDER BY
========

Description
-----------

``ORDER BY`` clause specifies which fields used to sort the result and in which direction.

Example 1: Ordering by Fields
-----------------------------

Besides regular field names, ordinal, alias or scalar function can also be used similarly as in ``GROUP BY``. ``ASC`` (by default) or ``DESC`` can be appended to indicate sorting in ascending or descending order.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : "SELECT account_number FROM accounts ORDER BY account_number DESC"
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 200,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "account_number"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  },
	  "sort" : [
	    {
	      "account_number" : {
	        "order" : "desc"
	      }
	    }
	  ]
	}

Result set:

+--------------+
|account_number|
+==============+
|            18|
+--------------+
|            13|
+--------------+
|             6|
+--------------+
|             1|
+--------------+


Example 2: Specifying Order for Null
------------------------------------

Additionally you can specify if documents with missing field be put first or last. The default behavior of Elasticsearch is to return nulls or missing last. You can make them present before non-nulls by using ``IS NOT NULL``.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : """
		SELECT employer
		FROM accounts
		ORDER BY employer IS NOT NULL
		"""
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 200,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "employer"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  },
	  "sort" : [
	    {
	      "employer.keyword" : {
	        "order" : "asc",
	        "missing" : "_first"
	      }
	    }
	  ]
	}

Result set:

+--------+
|employer|
+========+
|    null|
+--------+
|  Netagy|
+--------+
|  Pyrami|
+--------+
| Quility|
+--------+

Note that the example above is essentially sorting on a predicate expression. In this case, nulls are put first because it's evaluated to false (0), though all the rest are evaluated to true and still in random order. If you want to specify order for both nulls and non-nulls, ``NULLS FIRST`` or ``NULLS LAST`` in SQL standard can help. Basically, it allows you to specify an independent order for nulls along with ``ASC`` or ``DESC`` keyword::

    od> SELECT employer FROM accounts ORDER BY employer ASC NULLS LAST;
    fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
    +------------+
    | employer   |
    |------------|
    | Netagy     |
    | Pyrami     |
    | Quility    |
    | null       |
    +------------+

The sorting rule can be summarized as follows:

- Without ``NULLS`` clause

  - ``ASC``: sort non-nulls in ascending order and put nulls first
  - ``DESC``: sort non-nulls in descending order and put nulls last

- With ``NULLS`` clause: just use the nulls order given

Here is another example for sort in descending order without ``NULLS`` clause::

    od> SELECT employer FROM accounts ORDER BY employer DESC;
    fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
    +------------+
    | employer   |
    |------------|
    | Quility    |
    | Pyrami     |
    | Netagy     |
    | null       |
    +------------+


Example 3: Ordering by Aggregate Functions
------------------------------------------

Aggregate functions are allowed to be used in ``ORDER BY`` clause. You can reference it by same function call or its alias or ordinal in select list::

    od> SELECT gender, MAX(age) FROM accounts GROUP BY gender ORDER BY MAX(age) DESC;
    fetched rows / total rows = 2/2
    +----------+------------+
    | gender   | MAX(age)   |
    |----------+------------|
    | M        | 36         |
    | F        | 28         |
    +----------+------------+

Even if it's not present in ``SELECT`` clause, it can be also used as follows::

    od> SELECT gender, MIN(age) FROM accounts GROUP BY gender ORDER BY MAX(age) DESC;
    fetched rows / total rows = 2/2
    +----------+------------+
    | gender   | MIN(age)   |
    |----------+------------|
    | M        | 32         |
    | F        | 28         |
    +----------+------------+

LIMIT
=====

Description
-----------

Mostly specifying maximum number of documents returned is necessary to prevent fetching large amount of data into memory. `LIMIT` clause is helpful in this case.

Example 1: Limiting Result Size
-------------------------------

Given a positive number, ``LIMIT`` uses it as page size to fetch result of that size at most.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : """
		SELECT account_number
		FROM accounts
		ORDER BY account_number LIMIT 1
		"""
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 0,
	  "size" : 1,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "account_number"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  },
	  "sort" : [
	    {
	      "account_number" : {
	        "order" : "asc"
	      }
	    }
	  ]
	}

Result set:

+--------------+
|account_number|
+==============+
|             1|
+--------------+


Example 2: Fetching at Offset
-----------------------------

Offset position can be given as first argument to indicate where to start fetching. This can be used as simple pagination solution though it's inefficient on large index. Generally ``ORDER BY`` is required in this case to ensure the same order between pages.

SQL query::

	POST /_opendistro/_sql
	{
	  "query" : """
		SELECT account_number
		FROM accounts
		ORDER BY account_number LIMIT 1, 1
		"""
	}

Explain::

	{
	  "from" : 1,
	  "size" : 1,
	  "_source" : {
	    "includes" : [
	      "account_number"
	    ],
	    "excludes" : [ ]
	  },
	  "sort" : [
	    {
	      "account_number" : {
	        "order" : "asc"
	      }
	    }
	  ]
	}

Result set:

+--------------+
|account_number|
+==============+
|             6|
+--------------+
